# US Demographics FastAPI Project

This project utilizes the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) machine learning algorithm to analyze and visualize demographics data of the United States. 

## Overview
The project is built with FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It provides the infrastructure to build APIs quickly with the flexibility to design, develop, and deploy robust web applications.

## Features
- **DBSCAN Algorithm**: Implements the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster demographic data effectively.
- **FastAPI**: Utilizes FastAPI for building a high-performance API to interact with the clustering results.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visualizations of demographic clusters for better understanding and interpretation.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for usage and implementation details.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/boopathiviky/usdemo-fastapi.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the FastAPI server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000` and explore the available endpoints.

## Dependencies
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
